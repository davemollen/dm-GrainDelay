## MOD installation

Install the plugin from the MOD Audio plugin store.

The latest MOD builds can also be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-GrainDelay/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.

## MOD Desktop installation

You can download the MOD Desktop lv2 plugin for Linux, Windows and macOS from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-GrainDelay/releases). You can use the plugin in other lv2 hosts too, but you'll only have a GUI on MOD Desktop.

## VST2

Legacy code for a VST2 plugin is also in this repository. Since VST2 has been deprecated automated builds for VST2 have been excluded.
